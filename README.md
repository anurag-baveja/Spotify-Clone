My Spotify Clone is a web-based music streaming application inspired by the popular platform, Spotify. Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and I implemented JavaScript to handle user input and interaction such as basic playback controls - play, pause, and next.This project aims to replicate the sleek and intuitive user interface of Spotify while offering a customizable music streaming experience. Explore features like seamless playlist management, dynamic song recommendations.

Feel free to customize it based on specific features and aspects of your project!
